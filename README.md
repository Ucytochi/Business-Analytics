# Project Description

Given 3 datasets from Yandex.Afisha, we are to carry out analysis to optimize marketing expenses. These 3 datasets include:

* Server logs with data on Yandex.Afisha visits from June 2017 through May 2018.
* Dump file with all orders for the period.
* Marketing expenses statistics

And for the sake of this analysis, we name these files Visits, Orders, and Costs respectively.

In this analysis, we basically aim at looking at:

* How people use the product.
* How often the users visit.
* When do users start to buy.
* How much money each customer brings.
* When they pay off

The analysis is divided into 3 parts according to the datasets given. The first part of the analysis is covered in Product_Analysis.ipynb, followed by
Sales_Analysis.ipynb, and then Marketing_Analysis.ipynb. Afterwards, I made my conclusions and gave some recommendation.

The libraries used in this project are pandas, plotly, seaborn, matplotlib, numpy, and scipy.

Unfortunately, I do not have the rights to share the datasets used in this analysis.
